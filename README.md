## Development Requirements & Technical Considerations

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React/Next.js for component-based architecture and SEO optimization
- **Demo Visualization**: CSS Grid/Flexbox + SVG connections (no Canvas needed for fixed scenarios)
- **State Management**: React Context or simple useState for demo state transitions
- **Animation Library**: CSS animations + Framer Motion for pedal highlights and transitions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and mobile-first responsive design

### Demo Section Technical Risks & Mitigation

#### High-Priority Risks:
1. **Demo Layout Responsiveness**
   - **Risk**: 13 pedals difficult to display on mobile screens
   - **Solution**: CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints, collapsible/scrollable pedal rows
   - **Implementation**: Mobile-first design with simplified 3-4 pedal focus per scenario

2. **SVG Connection Line Rendering**
   - **Risk**: Complex signal chain connections may overlap or look messy
   - **Solution**: Bezier curves with collision detection, clean routing algorithms
   - **Fallback**: Simple straight lines with color coding for mobile

3. **Image Asset Loading**
   - **Risk**: 13 high-quality pedal images = slow initial load
   - **Solution**: WebP format with lazy loading, progressive image enhancement
   - **Implementation**: Placeholder images → Low-res → High-res progression

4. **Interactive State Management**
   - **Risk**: Complex step-by-step demo states getting out of sync
   - **Solution**: Simple state machine with clear step progression
   - **Implementation**: Single source of truth for current demo state

#### Medium-Priority Considerations:
5. **Cross-browser SVG Compatibility**
   - **Testing**: SVG rendering consistency across browsers
   - **Implementation**: CSS fallbacks for older browsers
   - **Performance**: Optimize SVG path rendering

6. **Animation Performance**
   - **Risk**: Multiple simultaneous CSS animations causing jank
   - **Solution**: Use `transform` and `opacity` only, hardware acceleration
   - **Implementation**: Stagger animations, limit concurrent effects

### Data Architecture
```javascript
// Sample data structure for demo state management
{
  scenarios: {
    srv_tone: {
      steps: [
        {
          id: "1-0",
          ui_state: {
            canvas: { pedals: [...], connections: [...] },
            animations: { highlight: [...], fadeIn: [...] }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Recommended Deployment Stack

#### Primary Recommendation: Firebase + Next.js
**Frontend**: Next.js (React) with static generation
**Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
**Analytics**: Firebase Analytics + Google Analytics 4
**Functions**: Firebase Functions (for contact forms, newsletter signup)
**CDN**: Firebase's built-in CDN

**Why Firebase for Dr.Effects Landing Page:**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: Free tier covers most landing page needs (10GB hosting, 125K function calls/month)
2. **Analytics Integration**: Native GA4 integration, user behavior tracking, conversion funnel analysis
3. **Marketing Tools**: Easy integration with Google Ads, Tag Manager, Search Console
4. **A/B Testing**: Firebase Remote Config for testing different demo versions
5. **Scalability**: Seamless upgrade path when full product launches
6. **Performance**: Global CDN, automatic SSL, HTTP/2 support

#### Alternative Options Considered:

**Vercel + Next.js**
- **Pros**: Best Next.js integration, excellent DX, automatic deployments
- **Cons**: Higher costs at scale (~$20/month for team features), limited analytics
- **Use Case**: If development speed is priority over cost

**Netlify**
- **Pros**: Great for static sites, built-in form handling, split testing
- **Cons**: Less integrated analytics, function limitations
- **Use Case**: If heavy focus on forms and lead generation

**AWS Amplify**
- **Pros**: Full AWS ecosystem, powerful backend capabilities
- **Cons**: Complex setup, higher learning curve, potentially higher costs
- **Use Case**: If planning complex backend features immediately
